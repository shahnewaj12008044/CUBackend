//^ shouldn't i do that also in user service. In this method  i have to write the same funcion in different models whereas in user service i can just do it by doing it once and then use it in all models.
//~ remarks on the above line: i tried it also but from user part its not that simple as expected cause here also every model like student, alumni rquires to update which makes the code little bit odd  although i did it using if else if statement.
